## About This App

Rock Paper Scissors Lizard Spock was built using [AngularJS](https://angularjs.org/) and [Bootstrap](http://getbootstrap.com/).

The icons in this app were acquired from iconfinder.com.

1) I first created the players, moves, and scoring objects and then created the calculation in order to find the winner between the user and the computer.

Note: This app is not currently working properly as there is currently a JavaScript error that is not allowing the app to run properly.
