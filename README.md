# Rock Paper Scissors - OVO Energy

## About This App

Rock Paper Scissors Lizard Spock was built using [AngularJS](https://angularjs.org/) and [Bootstrap](http://getbootstrap.com/).

The icons in this app were acquired from iconfinder.com.

1) Please run the application using MAMP as your local server to test
2) I first created the players, moves, and scoring objects and then created the calculation in order to find the winner between the user and the computer.

Note: This app is not currently working properly as there is currently a JavaScript error that is not allowing the app to run properly. I ran out of time and wasn't able to complete the fix for this.

What could I have done better?

1) I would've definitely gone through the same approach I did but would have really required more time and exposure to AngularJS in order to finalize the solution in its complete form. I didn't know much about AngularJS apart from an online course I did on that framework and am fairly happy with whatever I could achieve in the given time.
2) CSS: Due to shortage of time and majorly focusing on the AngularJS side of things, I wasn't able to really add more focus to the CSS part and if given more time, I would've made the CSS much more interactive with animations, media queries and responsive design (as AngularJS is not responsive by default)
3) Images: I have added images that I was intending to use in the application in order to show the user what they selected as their move and what the computer's move was, but once again, not enough time to fully complete this.
4) Adding some tests using jasmine.
